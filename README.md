### When to push through a problem on your own versus involving others?

As a Software Engineer or a Principal Software Engineer, deciding when to push through a problem on your own versus involving others is crucial for effective problem-solving and team dynamics. Here are some guidelines for each role, with examples:

### 1. **Software Engineer:**
   - **Push Through Solo:**
     - **When the problem is within your domain expertise:** If you're confident that you have the knowledge and resources to solve the issue without outside help, it’s often more efficient to push through on your own. 
       - *Example*: You’re debugging a specific bug related to Angular form controls that you've encountered before, or it involves a well-documented issue. You’re likely to solve it faster by researching or writing a fix yourself.
     - **When learning is beneficial:** If solving the problem on your own will deepen your understanding of a framework, language, or technology, it can be worth the time investment.
       - *Example*: You're trying to implement a custom directive in Angular. It's challenging but also a great opportunity to deepen your knowledge of Angular internals.
     - **When it’s not critical or time-sensitive:** If you have the luxury of time to work through the problem without it affecting deadlines or blocking others, it’s reasonable to keep working solo.
   
   - **Involve Others:**
     - **When the problem is blocking progress:** If you’re stuck on something that's preventing your team from moving forward, it’s time to ask for help to unblock others.
       - *Example*: You’re working on integrating a third-party library, but you’ve spent half a day without progress. You ask a senior engineer who has experience with the library to provide guidance.
     - **When there’s a lack of expertise:** If the problem involves technology or concepts outside your core expertise, seeking help from someone who is more familiar will save time.
       - *Example*: You need to troubleshoot an issue with a cloud infrastructure component (e.g., Kubernetes) that you’re not familiar with. Instead of spending days trying to figure it out, you consult with the DevOps team.
     - **When the problem impacts multiple people:** If the issue affects the entire team or product, it's important to collaborate early to avoid wasting collective time.
       - *Example*: You discover a performance bottleneck in a service used across teams. You bring this up in a team meeting to get more eyes on the problem and brainstorm solutions.

### 2. **Principal Software Engineer:**
   - **Push Through Solo:**
     - **When providing a technical deep dive or leadership:** In your role, there are times when you’ll need to push through difficult technical problems because your expertise will guide the architectural or design decisions for the entire team.
       - *Example*: You’re designing the microservices architecture for a new project, and it's important to create the initial proof of concept to validate decisions. You push through on your own to ensure the design is solid before presenting it to the team.
     - **When mentoring junior engineers:** Sometimes, solving problems on your own allows you to later share your process with junior engineers to help them grow.
       - *Example*: You debug a particularly tricky concurrency issue in a critical part of the application, and once resolved, you walk through the process with junior engineers to help them learn from your approach.
   
   - **Involve Others:**
     - **When a strategic decision requires input from others:** Even as a principal engineer, collaboration is key for strategic decisions that impact the direction of the product or architecture.
       - *Example*: You’re evaluating whether to adopt a new front-end framework across the organization. Instead of deciding unilaterally, you involve engineers from various teams to weigh in on the pros and cons.
     - **When cross-functional expertise is needed:** As a principal engineer, you're often the bridge between teams. When solving problems that span multiple domains, involving subject matter experts is crucial.
       - *Example*: You’re working on a performance optimization that requires changes in both the backend services and the front-end. You involve both the backend and front-end leads to coordinate the changes across teams.
     - **When fostering team growth and collaboration:** There are times when you may already know the solution, but involving the team encourages collaboration and helps others grow.
       - *Example*: A junior engineer is stuck on an issue related to the CI/CD pipeline. Instead of solving it yourself, you involve the team in troubleshooting and mentoring the junior engineer, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

### General Considerations for Both Roles:
- **Time and urgency**: How long have you been stuck, and how critical is it to the project timeline?
- **Learning opportunity**: Would working through the problem solo deepen your skills in a valuable area?
- **Impact on others**: Is your roadblock affecting other team members or deliverables?
- **Complexity and risk**: Is the problem complex enough that solving it incorrectly could introduce technical debt or instability?

Balancing solo effort with collaboration is key to maintaining productivity while fostering a learning and supportive team culture.


### Tell me about a time you had to deliver on multiple competing priorities. What did you do, and what were the results?

Dealing with multiple competing priorities is a common challenge in software engineering, and managing them effectively requires strong organizational skills, communication, and flexibility. Here's an example scenario illustrating how you might approach this:

---

### **Scenario: Delivering on Multiple Competing Priorities**
As a **Principal Software Engineer**, I was tasked with overseeing two critical projects that had overlapping deadlines. One was a **major feature release** for our product's front-end, and the other was a **critical performance optimization** for the backend that affected a high-value client. Both had tight timelines and high visibility from leadership.

### **Challenge:**
- **Feature release**: This required close collaboration with the design and QA teams and was tied to an important marketing launch.
- **Backend optimization**: This involved deep investigation into a production issue causing latency spikes, which was directly impacting our client’s business operations.

### **Approach:**
1. **Assess and prioritize tasks**:
   I started by understanding the urgency and impact of each project. The backend optimization had a more immediate and direct impact on business, while the feature release had a strict deadline for the product launch but could tolerate minor adjustments. After weighing the impact of each, I determined that I had to split my focus but lean more heavily into the backend work initially.

2. **Delegate and empower the team**:
   Since I couldn’t give my full attention to both projects at once, I delegated specific aspects of the feature release to capable team members. I identified a senior front-end engineer who could lead the UI work while I provided guidance and oversight on architectural decisions. This allowed me to stay involved without being a bottleneck. I also delegated testing and deployment-related tasks to the QA lead, ensuring proper communication channels for any critical issues.

3. **Time blocking and focused sprints**:
   I allocated specific blocks of time each day to work on both projects. Mornings were reserved for the backend investigation since it required focused deep work without distractions. Afternoons were dedicated to front-end work, team syncs, and reviewing progress. I also ensured frequent check-ins with both teams to remove roadblocks.

4. **Set expectations and communicate**:
   I communicated openly with stakeholders from both projects about my availability and progress. For the feature release, I identified potential areas where the scope could be reduced if needed, buying us more flexibility in case the backend work required extra time. I was transparent with leadership about the risks and trade-offs involved.

5. **Risk management and adjustments**:
   As the projects progressed, I realized the backend optimization was more complex than anticipated, so I brought in another backend engineer to help with parallel efforts. This allowed us to maintain momentum on both fronts without sacrificing quality.

### **Result:**
- The **backend performance issue** was resolved within the tight deadline, ensuring the client experienced minimal disruption, and we maintained a positive relationship with them.
- The **feature release** was delivered on time, albeit with minor scope adjustments. The marketing launch proceeded as planned, and the product team was satisfied with the outcome.
- Both projects were completed successfully without compromising quality, and I gained recognition from leadership for my ability to manage competing priorities effectively.

   - I also followed **YouTube tutorials** and read blog posts about DevOps best practices, learning how to optimize pipelines for efficiency.

4. **Practice Hands-On**:
   I learn best by doing, so I created a sandbox AWS environment where I could experiment with spinning up instances, managing S3 buckets, and configuring VPCs. I applied Terraform to automate the creation of this infrastructure and practiced deploying different versions of applications.
   - I also set up a **test CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins integrated with **GitHub Actions**, creating a simple workflow for automatically deploying code when changes were pushed.

5. **Seek Feedback and Mentorship**:
   I reached out to a **DevOps engineer** on our team who had more experience with AWS and CI/CD pipelines. I had regular check-ins with him, where I shared my progress and got feedback on my Terraform scripts and pipeline setup.
   - I also participated in internal discussions and asked questions during **DevOps team meetings** to get insights on best practices and potential pitfalls.

6. **Apply the Skill in a Real-World Project**:
   After a few weeks of learning and experimentation, I applied my newfound skills to one of our team's live projects. I helped automate the deployment of a web service using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, managing the infrastructure through Terraform and automating the deployment pipeline using Jenkins. 
   
   I made sure to document the entire process and shared it with the team, contributing to our shared knowledge base for future projects.

### **Result:**
- I successfully learned how to manage **AWS cloud infrastructure** and set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using Terraform and Jenkins.
- My work contributed to the team’s overall goal of automating deployments, significantly reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of human error during deployments.
- I became the go-to person for cloud-related questions on the team, which helped me expand my role and responsibilities within the organization.
